`suxx-tracker` suxx, because

 * its name is ugly in both lower and Capitalized Case
 * it is too verbose and too concise at the same time
 * it is a plain text file that can not be parsed
 * you need to pass GitHub registration and know the interface

## Suxx Tracker Contents

- [Mailman](#mailman)

- [Python](#python)
    - [virtualenv](#virtualenv)

- [Ubuntu PPA](#ubuntu)

## Mailman

`mailman` 2.x mailing list software suxx, because

 * it doesn't have search button for its archives
 * you can't reply to the thread if you're not already subscribed
 * you can't subscribe only to threads you're interested in
 * if you are not subscribed, there is no guaranteed mail delivery
   because it is not clear if you address will be added to CC

## Python

### virtualenv

`virtualenv` (python-virtualenv) suxx, because

 * you can't just login and logout from the env, you need to `activate` it

## Ubuntu PPA

`Ubuntu PPA` suxx, because

 * you can't just `install inkscape from https://launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable`.
 * `PPA launchpad pages` like https://launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable just don't have a straightforward single *visible* command needed to the istall the stuff right away ([launchpad#1458513](https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1458513))
