`suxx-tracker` suxx, because

 * its name is ugly in both lower and Capitalized Case
 * it is too verbose and too concise at the same time
 * it is a plain text file that can not be parsed
 * you need to pass GitHub registration and know the interface

## Suxx Tracker Contents

- [Python](#python)
    - [virtualenv](#virtualenv)

- [Ubuntu PPA](#ubuntu)

## Python

### virtualenv

`virtualenv` (python-virtualenv) suxx, because

 * you can't just login and logout from the env, you need to `activate` it

## Ubuntu PPA and Launchpad

`Ubuntu PPA` suxx, becuase you can't just `install inkscape from https://launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable`.

`PPA pages on Launchpad` suxx, because the page at https://launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable doesn't contain a single *visible* command needed just to the istall the stuff right away.
